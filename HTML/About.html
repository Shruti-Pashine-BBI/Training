    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This WMO project on world city forecasts is to explore 
    the wider exchange and availability of official weather information on the Internet. In view of this, 
    a WMO-sponsored website - World Weather Information Service (WWIS) is established as a centralized source on the Internet for media to access 
    official weather information issued by National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) efficiently and effectively. The WWIS website is developed
     and maintained by the <b>Hong Kong Observatory</b> (HKO) of <b>Hong Kong, China.</b>
</p>
<h3>This global website presents OFFICIAL weather observations, weather forecasts and climatological information for selected cities supplied by NMHSs worldwide. The NMHSs make official weather observations in their respective countries. Links to their official weather service websites and tourism board/organization are also provided whenever available. Weather icons are shown alongside worded forecasts in this version to facilitate visual inspection.
</h3>
<h3>The media are welcome to make information presented in this website available to the public. When doing so, credit to the respective NMHSs should be given.
</h3>
<h3>By June 2023, WWIS provided official weather information for 3451 cities in which 3307 cities are available with forecast from 139 Members while 2209 cities are available with climatological information from 171 Members. Suggestions to enrich the contents of this website are welcome.
